# discrete-optimization
Try dynamic programming,  local search, branch and bound, MIP to solve lots of famous optimization 


This folder currently contains my optimization codes. The questions I'm solving are asked in the coursera classs "discrete optimization".
The link of the class is here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization/home/welcome

That's the best discrete optimization class I've ever taken.

I was initially inspired by a Kaggle optimization competition. https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-workshop-tour-2019
Using manual hill climbing with simulated annealing and some custom stochasticity, I could only reach to 15% in the competition. I've felt it's a time for me to learn some state-of-the-art optimization algorithms in depth. Therefore, I've created this folder for discrete optimization.

In this folder, I'll post the weekly assignment problems and my answer code here.
